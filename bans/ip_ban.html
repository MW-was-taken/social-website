  <h1>Welcome to Hell.</h1>
  <p>You have been IP banned. You aren't returning from this one. If you ended up here you're gone. IP bans aren't reversed and 
    requests to revoke the ban are shunned. I can only wonder what one user has to do to see this screen. We're not sorry.

  <a>Fuck you.</a>
